### Firefly-Algorithm
In this repository there is the PDF thesis of my Bachelor Degree in Physics, based on Swarm Intelligence. 

You can also find the code of Firefly Algorithm (FA) that I have implemented in Python, using the [DEAP module](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

This algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm and mimics a fireflyâ€™s attraction to flashing light. It has been proposed by Yang (2008) at the University of Cambridge.


In this project the behaviour of the Firefly Algorithm has been tested on various benchmark functions and compared with Genetic Algorithms (GA), a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA).
